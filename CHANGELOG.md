## [0.10.0-rc1] - 2023-04-18
### Added
- Separate builds for Nina and PicoW microcontrollers, with the ability to use variants for the MiniMQTT dependency. Will show up as two archives, one ending in `_nina.zip` and other in `_picow.zip`, for both artifacts and release bundles.
### Changed
- Most code from `code.py` moved to `lib/wificom/main.py` with minor changes to accomodate this. This code can now be included in the release `mpy` builds for faster startup times.
- Updated `dmcomm-python` to v0.6.0 (basic Digimon Color support, DMOG fix).
- For messages which can appear in serial mode, changed ending of output lines from "\n" to "\r\n" to match Arduino.
- Disabled auto-reload on CIRCUITPY changes, except when in dev mode.
### Tested with
- CircuitPython 8.0.5

## [0.9.0] - 2023-02-27
### Added
- Sound on/off config option
- MQTT retries on connection failure (set to 3 times)
- New function connection_failure_alert() in code.py to handle shared wifi/mqtt failure alerts
- GitHub Action to compile libraries into mpy files
- Multiple WiFi network support, configured through secrets.py, see secrets.example.py for updates
- Retry each WiFi network up to 3 times each before moving on to the next
- New sound "beep_wifi_failure" for when WiFi fails to connect
- Audible beep for when a DigiROM is received via MQTT while on Wifi mode
### Changed
- Punchbag DigiROMs moved to `config.py` (`digiroms.py` removed)
- Changed recommended `prong_in` on "Pi Pico + AirLift" from GP26 to GP22
- Can now return to punchbag menu from a punchbag DigiROM
- Updated dmcomm-python to v0.5.0
- Default mqtt server in secrets.example.py is now "mqtt.wificom.dev", changed from "mqtt-production.wificom.dev
- Renamed secrets.py.example to secrets.example.py
### Removed
- In secrets.py the values "ssid" and "password" are no longer used, removed from example.  Users must now use wifi_networks array instead.  This is a breaking change, you will get errors connecting to WiFi until you update your secrets.py file to match secrets.example.py
- Combined merge-libs-from-remote.yml GitHub Action into single file with mpy compilation
### Tested with
- CircuitPython 8.0.2 (note: does not work with more recent)

## [0.8.0] - 2023-02-15
### Added
- Audio prompts for Pendulum X RTB
- GitHub Action for combining third party libs into one archive for easy installation on microcontrollers
### Changed
- Errors with secrets.py are caught, and displayed on the screen when attempting WiFi (other modes are able to run)
- Reboot when entering WiFi mode for a second time to avoid reinitialization errors
- Updated README.md to reflect new installation process
- Updated README.md to more accurately reflect current project status
### Tested with
